# 🌍 GlobalLaunch AI  
**Your AI Co-Pilot for International Startup Expansion**

GlobalLaunch AI is an AI-powered platform that helps startups gain new perspectives on global expansion using public economic and regulatory data. By combining MongoDB's advanced vector search with Google's Gemini and Vertex AI, it transforms raw country indicators into strategic insights — letting users explore where and how to grow globally.

Whether you're building a cross-border SaaS or a cleantech company exploring incentives, this platform offers clarity, explainability, and speed — all wrapped in a modern UX.

## 📊 Public Dataset Used

We used country-level economic, regulatory, and digital development indicators — including:

- FDI inflows
- Corruption Index
- Ease of Starting a Business
- Digital Infrastructure Index
- Trade Incentives & Policy Snapshots

These were cleaned, parsed, and embedded using Google Vertex AI, then stored in MongoDB Atlas with vector search indexing.

## ✨ Features & Insights Unlocked

- 📄 **Idea Input via Text or PDF**  
  Upload a startup idea or pitch deck and extract insights instantly.

- 🔍 **Smart Sector Detection**  
  Uses Gemini to classify ideas into top 3 sectors (e.g., Fintech, AI-ML, Healthtech).

- 🌐 **Top Country Shortlisting**  
  Combines semantic embeddings + key indicators (FDI, corruption index, digital readiness) to rank best-fit countries.

- 📊 **AI-Generated Country Reports**  
  Each shortlisted country includes a 6-part report covering market opportunity, regulatory climate, risks, incentives, strategy, and localization.

- 💬 **Interactive Chatbot**  
  Ask custom questions like “What are Estonia’s licensing laws?” or “Compare Germany and Brazil.” Powered by Gemini + real-time RAG.

- ⚡ **Semantic Embeddings**  
  Each country-sector profile is embedded using Vertex AI for fast, accurate vector search.
